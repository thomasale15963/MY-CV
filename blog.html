                Relative or Absolute Measuremnts?

                        Accessibility is the main factor to weigh in when evaluating websites. But accessibility shouldn’t be for the sake of just being able to open the page on various devices. It would be quite pointless if the page isn’t equally functional and usable. Considering
                        a page with its components all over the screen with no structuring an accessible page would be a joke. Sometimes, no amount of zoom might even structure the page well enough. Pages developed with fixed measurements like pixel aren’t
                        responsive to various devices thus we can can’t consider pages of these sort as accessible.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Currently, technology evolves at such a rapid pace that considering some functional features of devices obsolete is of no surprise. At some point, zoom may be considered outdated feature of devices. Imagine a web page developed with fixed measurements
                        like pixels at such times. The page will suffer the same faith at the major feature it depends on. Just like zoom the web page would be considered old and unattractive unless it is developed from scratch.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        It is very difficult conducting web page use through zoom. Zooming to specific sections of the page while losing the access to view sections on the other side. What if a comparison between the content located in the sections is being conducted? Nonetheless
                        even if no comparison is being held, using web pages on the entirety of structuring through zoom is tedious and unfriendly.

                What does CSS3 offer?
            </p>
            <article>
                <ul>
                    <li>In CSS2 developers were only allowed to use "web-safe-fonts". These are fonts that definitely exsisted on very machine. This helped secure the display of the content on any device. Some of the examples of this font are: Arial, Calibri
                        and Helvetica. However, in CSS3, designers can use fonts like those available on Google Fonts and Typecast. This allowed fonts like Oswald and Roboto be accessible for use.</li>
                    <li>
                        CSS3 has the ability to split sections into multiple columns much like a newspaper. This was a Colossal problem in CSS2 as it was not equipped with methods that automatically break the text so that it fits within a box.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        New attribute selectors have been added to CSS3. Selectors like element [foo^=” X”], element[foo$=”X”] and element[foo*=”X”]. The [foo^=”X”] signifies that the element has an attribute foo which begins with X. The [foo$=”X”] signifies that the element
                        has an attribute foo which ends with. Finally, the [foo*=”X”] signifies that the element has an attribute foo which has the string X.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        16 new pseudo-classes have been added to CSS3. Some of these are:-
                        <ul>
                            <li>:root: - Signifies the root element of the document.</li>
                            <li>:nth-child(n): Matches to the nth child of a certain parent.</li>
                            <li>:nth-of-type(n): Matches to the nth element of the same type.</li>
                            <li>:last-child: Selects the last child of a certain parent.</li>
                            <li>:only-child: Matches the only child of a parent.</li>
                            <li>:empty: Matches element that have no children.</li>
                            <li>:enabled: Matches the element when enabled.</li>
                            <li>:checked: Matches a checked radio or checkbox.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>New properties to background have been added. These are:-
                        <ul>
                            <li>Background-clip: Defines how the background images must be clipped. The default is the border box, but it can be changed to the padding box or the content box.</li>
                            <li>Background-origin: This property determines whether the background should be placed in the padding box, the border box, or the content box.</li>
                            <li>Background-size: This property indicates the size of the background image. It allows you to stretch smaller images to fit the page.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Similarly, some additions have been made to borders.container
                        <ul>
                            <li>Border-radius: These properties allow you to create rounded corners on your borders.</li>
                            <li>Border-image-source: Specifies the image source file to be used instead of border styles already defined.</li>
                            <li>Border-image-width: Defines the value of the width for your border image.</li>
                            <li>Border-image: The shorthand property for all the border image properties.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        CSS3 now comes with Media Queries. Media queries allow you more flexibility when defining how a style sheet should be used. For instance, you could define a style sheet that is only for handheld devices that have a viewport larger than 20em.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        In summary some other changes include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Creating grids with CSS.</li>
                            <li>Outline text and even create drop-shadows with CSS.</li>
                            <li>Color module Now comes with opacity.</li>
                            <li>New cursors, responses to actions, required fields, and even resizing elements.</li>
                            <li>Provides support for languages that use textual ruby.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
